## ML in JS
1) Supervised learning
* classification - prediciting value in the form of categories
* regression -  predict the outcome of the given sample (output is in the form of real values)

2) Unsupervised learning
* Association - probability of co-occurance of items
* Clustering - object in one cluster are simmiliar
* Dimensional Reduction - reducing the information, just the important are persisted

3) Reinforcement learning - maximizing the reward
